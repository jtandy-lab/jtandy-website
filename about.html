                    <h2 style="margin-bottom:1.25rem;">The problem I know too well</h2>

                    <p>When I started in business, I did everything right — or so I thought. I was focused, driven, and
                        certain I'd hit my goals.</p>

                    <p>But I got so deep into delivering the work that I forgot about everything else. Lead generation,
                        marketing, systems — all neglected.</p>

                    <p>I ended up relying entirely on word of mouth. Every conversation with a marketer felt like
                        gambling with money I couldn't afford to lose. And my cashflow was so unpredictable that
                        spending anything felt like a risk.</p>

                    <p>Meanwhile, my website existed — but I had no idea if it was actually generating anything. Forms
                        might have been broken. Leads might have been leaking. I didn't know because nobody had checked.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>I didn't know how my business was meant to stay alive.</strong></p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- STORY PART 2 -->
    <section class="s-tint">
        <div class="container">
            <div style="max-width:660px;" class="reveal">
                <span class="tag">The Shift</span>
                <h2>I stopped outsourcing thinking and started learning</h2>
                <div class="story" style="margin-top:1.25rem;">
                    <p>I spent years studying strategy, system design, and buyer
                        psychology. Not because I wanted to
                        become a marketer, but because I needed to understand what customers actually want before they
                        trust a business with their money.</p>
                    <p>The breakthrough was simpler than I expected: <strong>customers don't want complexity.</strong>
                        They want a clear, trustworthy path from "interested" to "ready to pay."</p>
                    <p>So I built exactly that. A simple, strategic website with
                        clear messaging, forms that worked, and
                        leads arriving where they should — email, CRM, WhatsApp. No leaks. No guesswork. One system.</p>
                    <p>The result was immediate and measurable.</p>

                    <p>Anxiety about where the next customer is coming from. Overwhelm from trying to do everything.
                        Frustration with marketers who speak in jargon and can't show results.</p>

                    <p>I combine strategy, psychology-informed messaging, and modern build tools to create websites that
                        do one thing well: convert visitors into paying customers.</p>

                    <p>Every recommendation I make is backed by evidence. I don't tell you "I think this looks good." I
                        show you what works, and why — so you're never gambling on opinion.</p>
